Android app that use tensorflow lite pre trained model to apply neural style transfer to the camera output

This code is an adaptation of the tensorflow exemple : https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/style_transfer/android

Instead of taking a photo and applying the style on it, it display the new style directly on the phon screen.

May be better to have more the 256x256 models!
